**ccbp-timeline** is a recruiter-ready **portfolio hub** that consolidates multiple production-style React apps into a single, easy-to-scan timeline experience. Instead of forcing reviewers to dig through folders, the timeline provides a **one-click path: overview → live demo → code**, reducing evaluation time and making project depth obvious within seconds.

This repository showcases **real product behaviors** that teams ship daily: routing, state management, loading states, reusable components, responsive layouts, and clean folder organization. The timeline UI itself is built with **React + react-chrono**, configured as a horizontal, responsive timeline with custom cards and icons to clearly separate **Course** vs **Project** items.

### What this repo demonstrates (engineering signals)
- **UI architecture:** reusable, component-driven structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Routing + navigation:** dynamic routes and detail views using React Router patterns
- **State management:** global state workflows using **React Context API** (provider/consumer patterns)
- **UX correctness:** loaders/spinners during async load, empty-state handling, totals and counts, and clean responsive layout
- **Code quality:** consistent structure, maintainable components, and documentation that supports fast reviewer setup

### Projects included (shown inside the timeline)
- **BlogList App** — blog listing + detail pages using dynamic route parameters, loading indicator, responsive UI  
- **Digital Clock App** — real-time UI updates with predictable rendering behavior  
- **Contacts App** — contact CRUD workflow using **Context API** + UUID-based ID generation  
- **E-commerce Cart App** — product listing + add/remove cart flows, cart count in navbar, total price calculation, empty-cart UX  
- **Context App** — authentication-style demo flow highlighting **createContext()** usage and shared state patterns  

### Tech stack
- **React.js**, **react-chrono**
- **React Router DOM** (routing-based apps)
- **React Context API** (global state)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**, **CSS3** (responsive layouts)

### Outcome / value
- Converts a folder of projects into a **single polished landing page** with clear proof of frontend engineering skills.
- Makes it easy for recruiters to validate capability fast: **demo + code + structure** in one place.
